    <h2>Milestone Deliverables</h2>
    <h2 align="middle">Update from Proposal</h2>
    <p>
        We have changed our subject from visual/rendering mods for games to 3D Robot/Skeleton Control based on the feedback
        from our TA. With that said we will now move on to the brief summary of progress and work. Towards the bottom,
        our previous project proposal is still intact as we were unsure if we still needed to host it. 
    </p>
    <h2 align="middle">Brief Progress</h2>
    <p>
        With our switch to 3D skeleton control and inverse kinematics we have so far finished a model of our robot that we will be 
        using throughout the process. The robot we have created is far from perfect but as the deadline nears we will be modifing the 
        body to create a somewhat cartoonish robot. The name we have given our robot is Beetle Juice and he was deigned through blender
        and many tutorials. With our model almost complete we have other work in progress which is a snippet of code for the control 
        of joints and the rigs for the robot. For our selection on control we are currently following the CCD algorithm for 2D 
        movement while we work on figuring out the rotation part for the animation. I would say that we are somewhat behind schedule 
        based on what we have so far but we should have the rigging done on the body by the end of this week and have an idea of 
        animation ready after the rigging. With that said we have an updated schedule for the due date.

    <h2>Project Proposal</h2>

    <h2 align="middle">Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Video games created in the early and mid 2000s were pioneering games that 
            sparked interest in many enthustiast's around the world, giving birth to the game industry as we know it.
            These video games pushed forth the desire for realistic graphics, open world maps, and advanced animations.  
            With the incline in graphic simulations, people tend to look back at the classics and wonder what 
            their cherished childhood games would looklike if realsed today. With that purpose, our team plans to 
            integrate high definition graphics/ textures, and advanced lighting to one of our childhood favorites.
            Our team consists of James Razo, Jesus Cebreros, Kevin Merino, and Noe Cebreros.
        </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Problem Description</h2>
        <p>
            Most older games were limited to the technology of their day. Due to the lack of mainstream
            heavy computational resources most games shipped with low quality graphics, minimial textures, 
            and had to sacrifice computational hungry tasks such as ray tracing. Such 
            games include Left 4 Dead, Half Life, Portal, and The Sims. Our team seeks to improve the 
            graphics of one of these four games by introducing lighting techniques from CS184 (raytracing),
            reproducing some texture layouts in HD, and possibly modifying the game engine for supersampling. 
            We will accomplish this through the use of shading tools or by creating new textures and updating them 
            according to the game scenery. We see an example image below of a scenery that could be 
            improved by introducing material modeling to the vehicle, possibly higher count raytracing, ambient
            occlusion, and higher definition textures. 
        </p>
        <div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/halfLife.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Half Life old gameplay taken online</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
    <p>
        It is important to us that we generate new graphics for one of these games because we grew up 
        playing them and we would like to breathe a new life into them via updated graphics.
        The challenges with this goal will be acquiring the correct tools to start modding one of these games; 
        learning how to use blender, or any other tool to update texture maps. Also, learning how to modify the 
        pre-existing rendering pipeline to introduce our own shading techniques and lighting effects.
        We forsee video game ray tracing as specially difficult not only because this is completely new to us
        but because it is a rather computational hungry task to accomplish in real time. 
        However, we believe through organization and maticulous planning we can introduce the above
        tasks into one our favorite video games. We would also like to have our game be playable, however,
        we would at least like to be able to render in-game footage that will showcase our upgrades. 
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p> 
            Since we have access to the original rendering's game scenery, we will be able to showcase our 
            improved quality graphics via a side by side image comparison of before and after environments. 
            Our goal is to deliver footage of the game through a cinematic walkthrough of different scenes
            that portray our modifications for a thrilling throwback experience. The quality should be 
            measured through the accuracy of the images, video framerate and texture pixel count.
            Our side by side comparison will ultimately answer whether our new modified scenery is a dramatic 
            improvement from the original scenery. We plan on showcasing what modern technology allows us todo
            to older game graphics. We expect to produce a partially modified game with breathtaking new scenery,
            reconstruct in high quality the more visually appealing textures and inject new shaders. 
            We expect to be unable to completely modify all game graphics in the allotted time period but we hope
            to target the game components that result in the most dramatic and appealing results.
            In order to accomplish this we plan to borrow techniques from shader mods used in minecraft, learn how to use 
            blender to create better visuals, and modify the existing pipeline to integrate everything. We 
            also intend on implementing or modifiying ray tracing to produce game scenes that look as realistic as possible.
            If everything goes according to plan, we hope to deliver an in-game footage with path-traced HD texture scenes.
            If we are able to get ahead of schedule, we plan on implementing real-time ray tracing on the GPU to achieve
            a fully playable remastered videogame.

    <h2 align="middle">Resources</h2>
        <p>
            For starters we will be looking into the Steam community for any tips on mods for games. We 
            will also look at the Nvidia webpage link provided to us and read some papers on ray tracing 
            techniques. This is really new to us so we are trying to figure out the direction for our 
            course of action.
